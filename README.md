# Dungeons & Dragons... in java!

## Why did I make this?

This project exists because I got sick of bad D&D companions,
so hopefully this doesn't fall into the same trap those do.

## How does it work?

I have no idea.

## Character Creator

The character creator creates new .dndc files, which is the custom file type for character sheets. These character sheets can then be read by the program for use
by both players and their DM. You may edit these character sheets later, such as by leveling them up.

## Bestiary

This companion will one day also come packaged with a complete 5e bestiary, with all information presented in a user-friendly way. You may also create custom enemies,
which are contained in the .dnde file format.

## Spell List

Packaged with the creator from the start is a spell list, as well as the ability to create custom .spell files.
